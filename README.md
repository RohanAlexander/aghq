# AGHQ: Adaptive Gauss Hermite Quadrature for Bayesian Inference

This package implements Bayesian inference using Adaptive Gauss-Hermite Quadrature, as specified in our paper. See also the accompanying software paper.

You can install the development version from Github:

```R
install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github('awstringer1/aghq')
```

You can also install the stable version from CRAN:

```R
install.packages('aghq')
```

The two papers linked above give a comphrensive overview of the method, application, and theory. Also see this paper 
and this talk for more examples of when AGHQ is useful in modern problems which use Bayesian inference.
