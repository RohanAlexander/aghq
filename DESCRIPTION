Description: Adaptive Gauss Hermite Quadrature for Bayesian inference.
    This package implements the AGHQ method for normalizing posterior distributions.
    A single core function implements the method and suitable plot and summary methods
    are included. The package contains several documented helper functions for users
    to customize their results. A theory paper and a software paper are forthcoming.
